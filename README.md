Three way Partitioning of an Array around a Given Range in Java
Here, in this page we will discuss the program for Three way partitioning of an array around a given range in Java programming language. We are given with an array and a range say [low, high], we need to partition the array in such a way,

All the elements less than low value, should come first.
Elements between the low and high value come in middle.
All elements greater than high should come at the last.
Three way partitioned
Method Discussed :
Method 1 : Using Brute Approach
Method 2 : Using Dutch Algorithm
Letâ€™s discuss them one by one in brief,

Method 1:
In this method we use recursion. At each point in the recursion, we append 0 and 1 to the partially formed number and recur with one less digit. 

Three Way Partitioning of array in Java
Method 1 : Code in Java
Run
import java.util.Arrays;
class Main{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        int arr[] = { 23, 5, 18, 10, 20, 89 };
     
        int n = arr.length, low = 1, high=4;
     
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
    }
}
Output :
5 10 18 20 23 89

Find Largest sum contiguous Subarray

Minimize the maximum difference between heights 

Method 2:
We traverse given array elements from left.
We keep track of two pointers, first (called start in below code) to store next position of smaller element (smaller than range) from beginning;
And second (called end in below code) to store next position of greater element from end.
Method 2 : Code in Java
Run
import java.io.*;
class Main
{
    public static void threeWayPartition(int[] arr, int lowVal, int highVal)
    {
         
        int  n = arr.length;
         
        int start = 0, end = n-1;
        
        for(int i = 0; i <= end;)
        {
            if(arr[i] < lowVal)
            {
                int temp = arr[start];
                arr[start] = arr[i];
                arr[i] = temp;
                start++;
                i++;
                 
            }
            
            else if(arr[i] > highVal)
            {
                int temp = arr[end];
                arr[end] = arr[i];
                arr[i] = temp;
                end--;
                  
            }
             
            else
               i++;
        }
         
    }
     
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
     
     
        int arr[] = {1, 14, 5, 20, 4, 2, 54, 20, 87, 98, 3, 1, 32};
         
        threeWayPartition(arr, 10, 20);
  
        for (int i=0; i < arr.length; i++)
        {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
     
        }   
    }
}
Output :
1 5 4 2 1 3 14 20 20 98 87 32 54
